If you came here from a job application, you know my name already.
I'm a software engineering student looking for co-op work through Carleton University.
Specifically something in Ottawa for the Winter Term 2026 and onward.


<h2 align="center"> I contribute to a couple of open source projects </h2>

| [timetable-kit](https://github.com/neroden/timetable-kit) | [FICSIT-Fred](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/FICSIT-Fred) |
| --- | --- |
| An application that makes easily readable timetables from public transit GTFS feeds. I am working on custom styling and additional features.  Runs on Python with Jinja2 templates.  | A Discord bot used to provide tech support to members of the Satisfactory Modding community server.  Runs on Python in a minimal Docker container. |

<h2 align="center"> I also make my own little projects</h2>

| [hardqoi](https://github.com/Borketh/hardqoi) | [FastAmogusCounter.jl](https://github.com/Borketh/FastAmogusCounter.jl) |
| --- | --- |
| A SIMD-optimized implementation of the Quite Ok Image format. Written in a mix of really cursed Rust and Intel assembly. WIP - still working on implementations using the capabiities of AVX-512 throughout the process instead of just for hash processing. Currently stuck on one particular problem where sequential read-writes are necessary (not possible with SIMD!). | Very silly. When r/place was a thing, my friend [Feyko](https://github.com/Feyko) had a friendly competition to see how fast we could find all the little pixel crewmates in any frame of r/place. Mine ended up being faster than [analysus](https://github.com/Feyko/analysus) but was fairly cursed in its implementation. Runs (somehow) on Julia using way too many weird tricks. |
